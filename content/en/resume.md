Hi, I'm Jack. I'm in my final year of university studying **BSc (Hons) Software Development**. My focus is interactive software such as video games.

I love programming and usually work on side projects. This includes creating mods for my favourite games, participating in game-jams and fun solo projects.

Beside programming, I enjoy playing games, D&D and my guitar. I travel with my friends when I get the chance.
