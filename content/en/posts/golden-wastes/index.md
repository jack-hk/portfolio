This is a solo project where I created an automated website. It includes scripts such as JavaScript and Python to create an entire Static Site full of rules from a TableTop RolePlaying Game (TTRPG). Since these rules are fundementally large pools of data, I made workflow that instantly converts between a readable JSON file, a docx/pdf view and my live website.

**Features:**
- My own custom HUGO theme with dark/mode and reading mode.
- Full accessibility and text-to-speech support.
- Workflow allows updated live website, generated PDF and JSON files.
- Detailed log files with a comparison view of new and old edited files.
